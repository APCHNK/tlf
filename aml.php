                    <p>
                        (1)In connection with the above listed threats, Trust Link Finance s.r.o. has
                        identified the following vulnerabilities (i.e., "weak spots" that may
                        facilitate a client's abuse of the services for ML-FT):
                        a. client identification: a person who does not wish to be associated with
                        the virtual assets service is interested in the services and therefore
                        another person (appearing to be the client), who is only the identity
                        provider, acts on his behalf and conceals that he is acting on behalf of
                        another person who does not actually wish to be associated with the
                        virtual assets service
                        b. client check: a client provides false, superficial or incomplete
                        information about the source of the financial resources because the
                        client expects that reviewing the source of the financial resources is a
                        very difficult or impossible process and expects the employee to
                        neglect this obligation or fail to perform it appropriately;
                        c. Persons against whom the Czech Republic applies international
                        sanctions (including persons involved in terrorism) are hidden in
                        complex and non-transparent ownership and management structures
                        of legal entities; such client expects that to uncover the ownership
                        and management structure of the client-legal entity and expects the
                        company to neglect this obligation or to perform it incompletely.
                    </p>
                    <span>6. Types of risk</span>
                    <p>
                        (1)Trust Link Finance s.r.o. has identified and assessed the following
                        threats:
                        a. High risk: abuse of the virtual assets services as a technique for the
                        legalization of resources originating from criminal activity, especially
                        resources originating from tax fraud, subsidy fraud, corruption
                        activity, breach of trust in administration others´ property, etc.
                        2 Article 6 (1) to (3) of the Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
                        20 May 2015 on preventing the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering or
                        terrorism financing, amending Regulation (EU) No 648 / 2012 and repealing Directive 2005/60 / EC
                        of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Directive 2006/70 / EC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        b. medium risk: international sanction evasion (i.e., changing the
                        nature of and transferring property of persons subject to
                        international sanctions)
                        c. medium risk: financing of terrorism
                        d. low risk: all other threats.
                    </p>
                    <span>7. Risk Factors</span>
                    <p>
                        (1)The risk factor is the characteristics of the client, the product provided
                        to him/her, or the way in which it is provided, which increases the risk
                        that services of the company Trust Link Finance s.r.o. might be misused
                        by the client for the purpose of money laundering or terrorism
                        financing, based on which the client is assigned a risk profile of the type
                        A, B, C, D or E.
                    </p>
                    <span>8. Risk profile - type A</span>
                    <p>
                        (1)The client is assigned a type A risk profile (client with no risk or with
                        minimal risk) in the absence of known risk factors to be assigned a type
                        B, C, D or E risk profile. These are therefore clients with no or only very
                        small and negligible risk that they could use the services of the company
                        Trust Link Finance s.r.o. for ML-FT purposes. This is a risk the company
                        is willing to accept.
                    </p>
                    <span>9. Risk profile - type B, C or D</span>
                    <p>
                        (1)The client is assigned a risk profile of the type B, C or D or E.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (2)A client with a risk profile of the type B, C or D represents for the
                        company Trust Link Finance s.r.o. a potential risk from the ML-FT
                        perspective and therefore all the employees, including the AML Officer,
                        must pay close attention to the assessment of any suspicion character of
                        this client's behaviour and place increased demands on the accuracy of
                        the information provided by the client during the first or ongoing
                        review, where appropriate, to substantiate the information disclosed by
                        a specific document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (3)The following risk factors relate to the type B, C or D risk profile, while
                        on the fact whether a risk profile of type B, C or D will be assigned to the
                        client based on the risk factors described here the employee will decide
                        in accordance with a special document for a risk assessment profile of
                        the client annexed to this Risk Assessment:
                        a. the client uses services that include transaction to or from a country
                        or territory that is identified as risky from the ML-FT perspective; a
                        list of these countries is given in Annex 5 of the Internal Rules
                        System;
                        b. the client requires a transaction that is unusually complex or largevolume,
                        or involves an unusual way of trading, or the economic and

                        activity that is "cash intensive" - that is, an activity that generates
                        large amounts of cash or other valuable commodities of a purely
                        anonymous nature, including virtual currencies (e.g., currency

                        h. a client whose behaviour has previously shown some signs of a
                        suspicious transaction but ultimately has not been classified as a
                        suspicious transaction, although doubts remain;

                        available, there is an increased risk of money laundering or terrorist
                        financing related to the high client’s turnover;
                        v. the payment or other service used by the client, or its nature or the
                        nature of individual transactions, is non-standard for the given type
                        of client;
                        w. any of the factors listed above, if it occurs in a legal entity in which
                        the client has a direct or indirect participation, or otherwise has the
                        opportunity to exercise influence over it.

                    <p>
                        (4)A risk country in this chapter is a country included in a list of countries
                        where measures against money laundering or terrorist financing are not
                        being applied to any extent or insufficiently. This list is included in
                        Annex 5 to the System of Internal Rules and it is necessary to keep it up
                        to date.

                    <p>
                        (5)The country of origin is understood in this chapter:
                        a. for a natural person, any state of which he or she is a national and, at
                        the same time, all other states in which he / she is registered for a
                        residence of more than 1 year or for permanent residence, if known,
                        b. for a legal entity that is a bank or financial institution, the state in
                        which it has its registered office,
                        c. for a legal entity that is not a bank or financial institution, the state in
                        which it has its registered office and simultaneously all the states in
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (6) The non-transparent ownership structure in this chapter means a
                        situation where the beneficial owner or ownership and management
                        structure of the client cannot be established based on:
                        a. a public register, records of trust funds or records of beneficial
                        owners kept by a public authority of the Czech Republic, or
                        b. a similar register or register of another state, or
                        c. any other source or combination of sources that the company
                        reasonably believes to be trustworthy and which it reasonably
                        believes to provide, in its entirety, complete and up-to-date
                        information on the beneficial owner and ownership and management
                        structure of the client, in particular when issued by a public
                        authority or officially legalized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (7)The ownership structure is not non-transparent if the client is a
                        company whose securities are admitted to trading on a European
                        regulated market or a foreign market similar to that of a European
                        regulated market if it is subject to disclosure requirements equivalent to
                        those of European Union law.

                    <span>10. Risk profile - type E</span>
                    <p>
                        (1)The client is assigned an E-type risk profile (unacceptable client) if any
                        of the risk factors listed below are present.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (2)A client with a risk profile of the type E represents for Trust Link
                        Finance s.r.o. a high risk in terms of money laundering and terrorist
                        financing. If the client is assigned a risk profile of the type E, the client
                        will not be provided with a virtual assets service or a business
                        relationship with the client, or the business relationship with him will be
                        terminated and no other service will be provided. In this situation, the
                        client is considered to no longer meet the client's acceptability criteria.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (3)In this case, termination of the business relationship or failure to
                        provide service will be ensured by the AML officer. It shall take all
                        necessary steps without undue delay to ensure that the business
                        relationship is effectively and legally terminated. In addition, it will
                        prevent the Client from being provided with any new services until the
                        business relationship is terminated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (4)Furthermore, great care must be taken when assessing whether the
                        client's conduct is showing signs of a suspicious transaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (5)The following risk factors relate to the type E risk profile:
                        a.there is a reasonable suspicion that the purpose of the business
                        relationship is to provide services to a person other than himself (i.e.,
                        the client acts only as an intermediary or identity provider) and the
                        client does not refute the suspicion;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        b. the client or a person associated with it (a member of the statutory
                        body, beneficial owner, etc.) or another payment recipient (if known)
                        is a person against whom the Czech Republic applies international
                        sanctions;
                        c. information provided by the client about himself / herself and his /
                        her activities are grossly contrary to the reality, which was found
                        from credible sources and the client did not justify the noncompliance;
                        d. there is a reasonable suspicion that the client is providing false,
                        misrepresented or incomplete information in the course of duration
                        of the business relationship or that he is submitting false or altered
                        documents;
                        e. business relationship with this client has been terminated in the past
                        due to the initiative of the company Trust Link Finance s.r.o. and the
                        client tries to establish it repeatedly;
                        f. the client or a person associated with it (a member of the statutory
                        body, the beneficial owner, etc.) is connected with another client with
                        whom the business relation was terminated in the past due to the
                        initiative of the company Trust Link Finance s.r.o.;
                        g. for other reasons, the client represents a significant risk to the
                        company in terms of money laundering or terrorism financing
                        h. any of the factors listed above, if it occurs with a legal entity in which
                        the client has a direct or indirect participation, or otherwise has the
                        ability to exercise influence over it.

                    <p>
                        (1)As stated in AML law, the company Trust Link Finance s.r.o. considers a
                        person to be PEP one year after the termination of its function.
                    </p>
                    <span>12. Exclusion of simplified identification and control</span>
                    <p>
                    (1)Simplified identification is applied only in case of clients with risk profile   of type A.

                    <span>13. Interval of updates</span>
                    <p>
                        (1)The employee will update the identification data, information on
                        whether or not the client is a PEP, whether the Czech Republic applies
                        international sanctions against him or his related persons whenever the
                        company Trust Link Finance s.r.o. gets to know about any change and at
                        least once in the following time intervals:
                        a. every 12 calendar months for a client with a risk profile of the type A
                        b. every 9 calendar months for a client with a risk profile of the type B,
                        c.every 6 calendar months for a client with a risk profile of the type C
                        and D.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (2)The update is done by searching for identification and other data in
                        public trusted sources or by asking the client if the identification and
                        other data (PEP flag) are still current. In the case of a client with a risk
                        profile of type B, C or D, it is not always sufficient within the framework
                        of the update to provide written confirmation of the timeliness of the
                        identification data, which Trust Link Finance s.r.o. keeps about the
                        client.

                    <p>
                        (3)The employee is obliged to create a record on the verification of
                        international sanctions and on the result, which always corresponds to
                        the requirement of retrospectibility according to chapter V.6 of the
                        System of Internal Rules, i.e., it contains at least the following
                        information:

                        automated);
                        b. a list of natural and legal persons that have been checked in the
                        sanction lists;
                        c. information on the sanction lists under which the verification was
                        carried out;

                    <p>
                        (1)If the client is assigned a risk profile of the type B, C or D, at the first
                        check of the client before establishing a business relationship:
                        a. the employee must check the source of client's financial resources
                        from an independent source, as opposed to only relying on the client's
                        oral or written statement (i.e., from bookkeeping records, third party
                        issued documents, audited documents etc.); the employee shall obtain
                        and keep a copy of such document (a simple Xerox copy shall suffice)
                        or shall keep the original document; otherwise the employee will not
                        execute the transaction with all the consequences (the client is
                        obliged to comply with such a request and if he refuses it, it is a
                        suspicious transaction that must be reported)
                        b. if the employee is not able to establish the controlling and ownership
                        structure of the client – a legal entity (up to the beneficial owner)
                        from public trustworthy sources (e.g., extracts from the register of
                        persons), he will require from the client not only to declare, but also
                        to demonstrate the control and ownership structure to the beneficial
                        owner;
                        c. if the client is a legal entity or a natural person doing business, the
                        employee will find out and record a detailed description of all the
                        client's activities in a really detailed way and he will verify it from
                        publicly available information (existence of appropriate business
                        licenses, officially available service offerings on the website, publicly
                        available client references, etc.) and if this information is not
                        available, it will request the client to evidence the activities.

                        (1)If the client is assigned a risk profile of the type B, C or D, the
                        establishment of a business relationship must be approved by the AML
                        officer or the Managing Director of the company Trust Link Finance
                        s.r.o. and creates a record of approval. Similarly, the AML officer or
                        Managing Director of the company Trust Link Finance s.r.o. mustapprove all and any substantial changes in the framework contract for
                        the provision of virtual assets services that have been triggered by the
                        client's request (e.g., request to increase limits, a new joint holder, etc.)

                        proof of economic activity in the form of 4 invoices from the suppliers
                        and 4 actual contracts.

                        (2)Business control of the client is focused on comparison of the real
                        business activity of the client to the one that was declared. It is
                        performed if the expected amount and volume of transactions is
                        exceeded by 50%. The client is supposed to provide confirmation about
                        his income and business activity and new limits should be set.
                        (3)In case the criteria for the mentioned business control were met, it is
                        necessary to ask the client to submit confirmation of income and
                        business activity (in case of using services for business purposes). Once
                        the business control happened, the new limits should be set for funds.
                        (4)If a client has been assigned a risk profile of the type D, the client's
                        source of funds must be verified from an independent source, not simply
                        relying on the client's oral or written statement (i.e., accounting
                        documents, third party documents, audited documents, etc.); the
                        employee shall make and keep a copy of such a document (a standard
                        copy is sufficient to be kept) or keep the original of the document;
                        otherwise the employee will not execute the transaction with all the
                        consequences (the client is obliged to comply with such a request and if
                        he refuses, it is a suspicious transaction that must be reported).
                        (5)Furthermore, in case of a client with a risk profile of the type B, C or D,
                        when:
                        a. the client uses services that include payment to or from a country or
                        territory that is identified as risky from the ML-FT perspective; the
                        list of these countries is given in Annex 5 to the System of Internal
                        Rules;
                        b. the client requires a transaction that is unusually complex or largevolume,
                        or involves an unusual way of trading, or the economic and
                        legal purpose of which is not obvious;
                        c. the client or its beneficial owner engages in a business or other
                        activity that is "cash intensive" - that is, an activity that generates
                        large amounts of cash or other valuable commodities of a purely
                        anonymous nature, including virtual currencies (e.g., currency
                        exchange, trade in precious metals, virtual currency, etc.);
                        d. the client or its beneficial owner carries on business or other activity
                        in the field of gambling, military industry and services, nuclear
                        energy;
                        e.in the course of business, the client or its beneficial owner handles
                        content accessible only to adults, with the exception of products
                        designed for direct consumption, such as cigarettes, alcohol, etc.;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (6)The employee will always ask the client for a wider range of the required
                        information (if it does not already have it) and will always investigate
                        the background and purpose and method of performing such
                        transactions.
