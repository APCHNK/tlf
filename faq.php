                            <p><span>SEPA</span> (Single Euro Payments Area) is a payment system designed to facilitate euro transfers between participating countries. Usually, transfers via SEPA can take several business days.</p>
                            <p><span>SEPA Instant</span> is a faster version of SEPA that allows you to make instant transfers in EUR. It is important to note that SEPA Instant transfers can take place in real time, even on weekends and holidays.</p>
                            <p><span>Main differences:</span><br>1. Speed: SEPA Instant transfers are processed instantly, while regular SEPA transfers can take several days.<br>
                            2. Availability: SEPA Instant is available around the clock, including weekends and holidays, while regular SEPA transfers work on bank business days.</p>
                            <p>Both options have their advantages depending on your needs. However, for now, Trust Link Finance has decided not to support SEPA Instant. This decision is based on security and protection of the interests of our customers in order to minimize potential risks.</p>
